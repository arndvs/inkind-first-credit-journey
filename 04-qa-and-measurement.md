# 04 — QA, Shipping, and Measurement

Success is a higher first-purchase rate within 7 days of entry than the 10% control group.

## 1. Before launch

### Who can receive it

- [ ] Canvas built and tested in a Braze dev workspace before it exists in production
- [ ] Test sends go only to a Braze Internal Test Group
- [ ] Send Settings are "subscribed or opted-in" on every message step, so an unsubscribed user who is in the Canvas still gets nothing on that channel
- [ ] Audience previewed against known test users (opted in, opted out, unsubscribed) before launch
- [ ] Braze audience count is at or below the warehouse SQL count, and the gap matches users with no push or email permission
- [ ] Send time resolves to the user's local time; quiet hours respected
- [ ] Workspace frequency caps reviewed: this Canvas fits under them or has a deliberate exemption
- [ ] A second person reviews the Canvas and audience before it goes live

### What they see

- [ ] Test profile shows each event and attribute with the right type (User Search, event user log)
- [ ] Liquid preview for seven test users: saved restaurant found in the Catalog (once from the entry event, once from saved_restaurants only), saved ID missing from the Catalog, nothing saved, nothing saved with the recommendations endpoint down, reward already used (no reward fields), reward missing its minimum (last two abort)
- [ ] Rendered push has no leading or trailing blank lines, shows "$25 toward a $50+ meal" (and "$12.50" for a non-whole amount) correctly, and stays under the push length limit with three long restaurant names
- [ ] Cloud Data Ingestion sync run shows the expected row count, and a test user's reward fields clear from the profile after the reward is marked redeemed in Snowflake
- [ ] Links are tracked and deep-link into the app; email renders in Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail and includes the footer with an unsubscribe link
- [ ] A test purchase removes the test user from the Canvas
- [ ] Browsing Canvas: a test user enters on their third session within 14 days, not before; saving a restaurant moves them out of it

## 2. How I'd ship it

- Add the `restaurant_saved` event and the `saved_restaurants` update to the Rails backend, sent to `/users/track` from a background job so the request path never waits on Braze
- Run it locally against Postgres and the Braze dev workspace, then check the test profile in User Search
- Open a PR with the payload change and a test for the event shape
- Backfill `saved_restaurants` for existing users with a one-time batched `/users/track` job, or through the warehouse sync, before the Canvas goes live, so people who saved restaurants before this shipped get personalized and aren't mistaken for non-savers by the browsing Canvas
- Turn on the Canvas in production only after the checks in section 1 pass

## 3. After launch

| Metric | Type |
|---|---|
| First purchase within 7 days, journey vs. control, for each Canvas | Primary |
| Reward redemption rate (first meal of $50+ paid in the app) | Secondary |
| First meals under $50 (converted, reward still unused) | Secondary |
| Days from signup to first purchase | Secondary |
| Results by signup-week cohort, journey vs. control | Secondary |
| Unsubscribes and push opt-outs | Guardrail |

## 4. What I'd confirm first

| Question | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Are browse and save events already reaching Braze, or only transactions? | Decides whether this is a data gap or a journey gap |
| How is the referral reward stored, and does it reach the Braze profile today? | The app keeps Rewards separate from inKind Cash and Cash Back, so the journey reads the reward record, not a wallet balance; a stale record means promoting a reward that's already used |
| Should a first meal under $50 count as converted? | It ends this journey, but the reward is still unused; that may deserve its own follow-up |
| What share of new users allow push? | Decides how much email has to carry |
| What is the session-count filter called in the Braze filter picker? | The browsing Canvas (02, section 4) depends on it; the SDK collects total sessions, but I haven't seen the filter's exact name |
| Does an existing referral or onboarding Canvas overlap with this one? | Avoids double messaging; may mean extending a Canvas instead of adding one |
