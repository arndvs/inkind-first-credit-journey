"""Test data: fictional restaurants, one case per Liquid preview in
04-qa-and-measurement.md, and a few edge cases.

Every restaurant name, address, description, rating, and ID here is made up, and any
resemblance to a real restaurant is coincidental. Location IDs use a demo- prefix so a
generated link can't open a real inKind listing. Photos are AI-generated sample images
stored in liquid/images/samples/ (labeled "Sample image"), never links to someone
else's photos: a full-width JPEG for cards, and a square JPEG for row thumbnails.
